OUTLINE

The basic premise of this game is that you are a blind person trying to accomplish everyday tasks.

The primary way you "see" in this game is clicking, and getting a limited view of your environment based on 
how sound waves hit and bounce off of objects. You also have a very limited visible area around your character.

CONTROLS

Clicking = left mouse button
Pause menu = escape button
